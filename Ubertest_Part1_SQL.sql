--Part 1:

--1. Between Oct 1, 2013 at 10am PDT and Oct 22, 2013 at 5pm PDT, what percentage of
--requests made by unbanned clients each day were canceled in each city?
--2. For city_ids 1, 6, and 12, list the top three drivers by number of completed trips for each
--week between June 3, 2013 and June 24, 2013.


--1. Answer to question 1

select a.request, a.cancelled_requests/b.requests as percent_of_cancelled_req from -----comment percent of cancelled request

---2a. Assuming the question is asking for top 3 drivers in cities 1,6 and 12 combined


select u.userid as drivers,count(id) as num_trips from trips t

and u.signup_city_id in (1,6,12)   ---- comment for the cities 1,6 and 12
and t.status='completed'

group by drivers
order by num_trips desc limit 3 --- comment top 3 drivers in the 3 cities combined

--2b. Assuming the question is asking for top 3 drivers in each of cities 1,6 and 12

select a.city,a.userid as top_driver_city_1,b.userid as top_driver_city_6, c.userid as top_driver_city_12
